// Identity is whitespace-, case- AND unicode-form-insensitive: tags routinely
// carry stray padding, inconsistent casing ("СЕРЕГА ПИРАТ" vs "Серега Пират"),
// doubled/non-breaking spaces and NFD-decomposed accents (macOS), and a key
// that differs on any of these would split one artist/album into several.
// NFKC additionally folds the full-width/half-width forms common in Japanese
// tags. The per-letter folds below cover casings toLowerCase() can't round-
// trip: uppercase tags erase İ/ı, ß→SS and ё→Е distinctions, so both sides
// fold to one representative. Genuine accents (é, è…) stay significant.
// Display keeps the first-seen (or already stored) spelling.
